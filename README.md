This project is created to learn more about developings apps with React Native.

## Technologies used 
**Built with**
- Sublime Text
- Visual Studio Code 
- React Native using Expo 

Sublime Text was only used in the early stages of this project. I selected this editor initially because Ray Wenderlich suggested it in their [tutorial on building iOS apps with javascript](https://www.raywenderlich.com/485-react-native-tutorial-building-ios-apps-with-javascript). 

However, the editor did not work properly and this resulted in a significant delay. One of the issues inludes color coding that does not work correct. For example, some lines showed the wrong color, which suggests that something is wrong with the code while the code was actually fine. 

Therefore, the switch to Visual Studio Code was made to enhance the ease of development.
